#Library Management System Project

This is a library management system project.
In this project, I used PHP as the main language. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and MySQL for the database. In this project, there are two sides to the portal: one is for students, and the other is for librarians.Â 

Student-side poratal features: 

1) Make a new registration using the register option.

2) Students can see available books and request a book issue.

3) Return the book.

4) The student can see how much fine he got.




Librarian side portal features:

1) See how many students have books with the details of the student, book name, and date.

2) See how many students didn't return books on time.

3) See the total fine for a student.

4) Take action, like mailing a student to return the book.
